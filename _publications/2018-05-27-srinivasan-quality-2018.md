title: "Quality assurance of bioinformatics software: a case study of testing a biomedical text processing tool using metamorphic testing"

excerpt: 'Bioinformatics software plays a very important role in making critical decisions within many areas including medicine and health care. However, most of the research is directed towards developing tools, and little time and effort is spent on testing the software to assure its quality. In testing, a test oracle is used to determine whether a test is passed or failed during testing, and unfortunately, for much of bioinformatics software, the exact expected outcomes are not well defined. Thus, the main challenge associated with conducting systematic testing on bioinformatics software is the oracle problem.'

Bioinformatics software plays a very important role in making critical decisions within many areas including medicine and health care. However, most of the research is directed towards developing tools, and little time and effort is spent on testing the software to assure its quality. In testing, a test oracle is used to determine whether a test is passed or failed during testing, and unfortunately, for much of bioinformatics software, the exact expected outcomes are not well defined. Thus, the main challenge associated with conducting systematic testing on bioinformatics software is the oracle problem.
