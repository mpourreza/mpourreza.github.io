excerpt: 'Identifying protein-phenotype relations is of paramount importance for applications such as uncovering rare and complex diseases. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a recently introduced standard vocabulary for describing disease-related phenotypic abnormalities in humans. Since the experimental determination of HPO categories for human proteins is a highly resource-consuming task, developing automated tools that can accurately predict HPO categories has gained interest recently'

Identifying protein-phenotype relations is of paramount importance for applications such as uncovering rare and complex diseases. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a recently introduced standard vocabulary for describing disease-related phenotypic abnormalities in humans. Since the experimental determination of HPO categories for human proteins is a highly resource-consuming task, developing automated tools that can accurately predict HPO categories has gained interest recently
