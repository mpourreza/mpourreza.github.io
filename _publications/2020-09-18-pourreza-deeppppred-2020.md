excerpt: 'The biomedical literature provides an extensive source of information in the form of unstructured text. One of the most important types of information hidden in biomedical literature is the relations between human proteins and their phenotypes, which, due to the exponential growth of publications, can remain hidden. This provides a range of opportunities for the development of computational methods to extract the biomedical relations from the unstructured text. In our previous work, we developed a supervised machine learning approach, called PPPred, for classifying the validity of a given sentence-level human protein-phenotype co-mention. In this work, we propose DeepPPPred, an ensemble classifier composed of PPPred and three deep neural network models: RNN, CNN, and BERT. Using an expanded gold-standard co-mention dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed ensemble method significantly outperforms its constituent components and provides a new state-of-the-art performance on classifying the co-mentions of human proteins and phenotype terms.'

The biomedical literature provides an extensive source of information in the form of unstructured text. One of the most important types of information hidden in biomedical literature is the relations between human proteins and their phenotypes, which, due to the exponential growth of publications, can remain hidden. This provides a range of opportunities for the development of computational methods to extract the biomedical relations from the unstructured text. In our previous work, we developed a supervised machine learning approach, called PPPred, for classifying the validity of a given sentence-level human protein-phenotype co-mention. In this work, we propose DeepPPPred, an ensemble classifier composed of PPPred and three deep neural network models: RNN, CNN, and BERT. Using an expanded gold-standard co-mention dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed ensemble method significantly outperforms its constituent components and provides a new state-of-the-art performance on classifying the co-mentions of human proteins and phenotype terms.
